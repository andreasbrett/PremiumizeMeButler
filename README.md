# PremiumizeMeButler

Premiumize.me is a great multihost downloading service. In order to automatically fetch folders that were
downloaded to the "my cloud" section I decided to build PremiumizeMeButler.

## Examples

Please see **example.py** for examples on how to fetch folders via PremiumizeMeButler. Please note that all
those examples use sample values. If you run these without modification **they will not work**.

## Obtain Authentication Data

You will need your Customer ID and PIN to let PremiumizeMeButler interact with your account. You will find
these in your Premiumize Account Overview at: https://www.premiumize.me/account
